Combat Extended compatibility patch for Start Wars Factions (b18).

Unofficial b18 update for the a17 patch by jaeger972 (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=974909952).

Notes:
- Apparel defaults to Bulk=1.0 and has not been patched (a17 patch uses Bulk=2.0).
- Set Imperial Credit Bulk=0 to avoid pawns loading with no ammo.

Credit for patch textures and a17 CE patch belong to jaeger972.

Original description (a17, jaeger972):

  The original mod belongs to Jecrell, Xen and harrison.
  Only the coding for Combat Extended and some of the new textures are my work so please give credit where credit is due.
  
  Deflection from the melee weapons sadly couldn't make it into the CE version.
  Due to the nature of CE the balancing of the weapons comparatively to the original version in vanilla rimworld is different.
  Like with everything else in CE you will wreck your enemies if you gain access to the Star Wars weaponry but keep in mind that faction raids will spawn with said weaponry.
  
  IMPORTANT!: This mod requieres JecsTools, Star Wars - Factions and Combat Extended.
  The load order should be: JecsTools -> Star Wars - Factions -> Combat Extended -> Star Wars - Factions(CE Patch)
